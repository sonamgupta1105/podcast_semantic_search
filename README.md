## Chat with Podcast Content
This project uses advanced AI tools to provide semantic search and a chat interface for analyzing and interacting with podcast transcript files. By integrating powerful AI technologies, this tool enables users to glean valuable insights and conduct meaningful searches through podcast content.

## Features
Semantic Search:
Search podcast transcripts with high precision using Cohere embeddings.
Enables contextual understanding, beyond simple keyword matching.

Chat Module:
Chat with podcast transcripts using Cohere's CommandR Plus language model.
Ask specific questions and receive insightful responses derived from the podcast content.

## Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Embeddings: Cohere Embedding v3
3. Vector Database: ApertureDB
4. Chat LLM: Cohere CommandR Plus

## Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later
2. A Cohere API key (for embeddings and chat functionality)
3. ApertureDB setup (refer to ApertureDB documentation: https://docs.aperturedata.io/Setup/client/adb)
